    "# Quantified Self  \n",

    "## 1. Introduction  \n",
    "In this Jupyter Notebook I will be exploring some of my own data through a multipstep process. The domain where my data is gathered from is Google Maps. Specifically. I am using my \"Semantic Location\" Data from the Google Takeout service. I am interested in doing research on this data because I want to see if I have different movement habits (i.e. deviation in distance travelled, amount of time taken, and activity type) during different portions of my life. Last Spring I studied abroad in Madrid, Spain, and I am especially curious to see if my movement patterns were different there than they are in Spokane.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### About my Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is in multiple JSON files which are seperated by month. The tables that I am including from the dataset are all from the \"Activity Segment\" portion of the JSON file, which is just periods when I moved from one location to another. The attributes of my Activity Segments that I am including are as listed in this chart:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start Timestamp** : Date and time when I started the activity segment (time zone accounted for)\n",
    "1. **End Timestamp** : date and time when I ended the activity segment (time zone accounted for)\n",
    "1. **Start Latitude** : Latitude (formatted with no decimal point) of starting location\n",
    "1. **Start Longitude** : Longitude (formatted with no decimal point) of starting location\n",
    "1. **End Latitude** : Latitude (formatted with no decimal point) of ending location\n",
    "1. **End Longitude** : Longitude (formatted with no decimal point) of ending location\n",
    "1. **Distance** : distance travelled in meters\n",
    "1. **Activity** : my method of travel. Activities that are represented in my data are walking, riding the subway, riding the bus, riding in a passenger vehicle (car), riding on a plane, riding a ferry, and riding a train\n",
    "\n",
    ">Note: This data was all collected by Google Maps through either cell service or GPS. \n",
    "  \n",
    "The data that I decided to pull from the dataset are from the time that I was studying abroad, which is roughly from Jan 21 2022 to May 5 2022, and additionally from last Summer when I was in Spokane, whcih is roughly from May 22 2022 to August 14 2022. This turns out to be about 642 instances for my study abroad data and about 363 instances for my Spokane data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypotheses  \n",
    "One of my hypotheses are that the activity types for the two samples will be vastly different, because I walked a lot more in Spain than I normally do. I also rode the subway and train, and we do not even have a subway in Spokane. I pretty much already know that the activity type for Spokane will be mostly \"passenger vehicle.\" Another hypothesis I have is that my average distance travelled in Spain was larger than in Spokane, but not by a lot. My reasoning is that although I did not have a car to travel large distances, I travelled by train and plane there occasionally. \n",
    "\n",
    "My next few hypotheses are only regarding the Spain sample. One hypothesis I have is that the mean distance travelled per day increased from the first half of my study abroad experience to the second half, because I got more comfortable and was probably travelling more. I also have hypotheses about my travel patterns in Spain on weekdays vs weekends. Specifically, I think that mean distance travelled over weekends will be larger than on weekdays, since I had more free time and did not have school. As a side note, I am including Fridays in my weekends because I did not have classes.  I am going to use the kNN algroithm and a Decision Tree to classify data on \"weekend\" vs \"weekday\" labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I am going to use the MeteoStat weather API to test my hypothesis that I did not travel significantly less distance when the temperature was lower. My reasoning is that I had to go to school most days no matter the weather, and also I tried to get the most out of my time there even if it was cold. It also did not get super cold except for when I first arrived there.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Impacts & Stakeholders  \n",
    "Mostly these results are to sate my own curiosity. However, a potential impact could be an imporved self awareness of my travel methods. In particular, maybe seeing how much I walked in Spain will motivate me to walk more back in Spokane. Potential stakeholders in this project is really just me and possibly students wanting to study abroad and Spain who want to know the most common modes of transport there.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)   \n",
    "Now that I have explained the data a little bit, we can continue to the EDA. This section will consist of loading the data, cleaning the data, making vizualizations, and finallly doing hypothesis tests.\n",
    "### I. Data Loading  \n",
    "#### a. Making a Dataframe\n",
    "The first step is to load the data from JSON format into one big dataframe that contains all the dates I need. Overall I need data from January, February, March, April, May, June, July, and August of 2022. I will split the data up later.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Note : I used [`pd.concat()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.concat.html) to combine the different months. "

    "The last step in cleaning this data will be to encode the Activity column into numeric data using the `sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder()`. This will help down the road when I will be doing hypothesis testing on my Activity data. I will still keep the original categorical Activity data just so it is more user friendly. So that the encoding is consistent across both dataframes, I will first concatenate them and make one large dataframe. Then after wncoding I will seperate them once again."
