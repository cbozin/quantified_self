# Quantified Self  
Author: Carolyn Bozin
Date Updated : 12/12/2022

A project where I perform Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning on my Google Maps Semantic Location data. The bulk of the work is done in the Jupyter Notebook QuantifiedSelf.ipynb.

### Project Dependencies
This project depends on my Google Semantic Location data, which is in a directory outside of this repo. It also includes a python file called utils.py that contains utility functions as well as a python file caled weather_data.py where I use the MeteoStat API to get Daily Weather data for Madrid during my time studying abroad there. The weather_data.py file uses my API key, which is stored in config.py outside of this repo. The other files in this repo are csv files that result from my work in QuantifiedSelf.ipynb, and are not dependencies for this project. 

### Organization  
This project is organized into 3 main sections: a short introduction to the dataset, a large section where I perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the data, and lastly a section where I classify the data using Machine Learning techniques.
